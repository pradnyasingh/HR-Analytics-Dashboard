# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

In this project I have analyzed Hr dataset of a company where we can observe the reason of attrition in various departments.
Firstly I have cleaned the dataset so that we can move forward to analyze proper dataset
Here there are five KPI's which shows Total employees, Attrition , Active Employees , Attrition rate , Average Age in the entire organisation.
The first graph shows Total Employees by Gender where the ratio of female employees is less than that of male
The second graph shows education wise attrition where employees having bachelors degree having more attrition count then those with other degree
The third graph shows attrition by marital status married people are having more attrition then people with different marital status.
The fourth graph shows which job role has the highest and least attrition.
The fifth graph shows department wise attrition .
And the last graph shows that R&D department has highest percentage of attrition and HR department has the least percentage of attrition.
